# Design purpose

Basic case for enclosing 192x96mm RGB matrix display. It's main purposes are:
 - enclose all electronics and cables inside
 - stand at desk with angle allowing user to easily read the display

Two holes are for power socket and for putting USB cable through (there is no nice enclosure-mountable micro usb with current PCB design - maybe in future).

Feet is dual angle - it allows to put it in slot two ways.
